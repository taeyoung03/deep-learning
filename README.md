This project predicts the likelihood of being accepted to a graduate school using deep learning models.

## Motivation
* Studying deep learning and TensorFlow

## Cloned from
[coding apple](https://codingapple.com/course/python-deep-learning/)

## Improvements
* Loss and accuracy vary each time I run the model -> Experimentation and research needed for data preprocessing and parameter tuning
